# Summary
This is a signaling proposal. If it passes, it indicates the community's willingness to raise a community pool spend proposal to support the Confio team in their stewardship of CosmWasm, CosmJS with the ATOM equivalent of $2.5M dispersed in two payments, in accordance with the process outlined below. 

# Purpose

Confio is the team responsible for the stewardship and development of the CosmJS & CosmWasm libraries, two key components of the Cosmos software stack. These libraries are highly valued by developers and chains across the Cosmos ecosystem. 

## Why should the Hub fund Confio? 

### Hard vs. Soft Power

In the coming months, a software upgrade proposal to adopt Gaia v.9.0.0 will be raised to the Cosmos Hub. This proposal will include replicated security, which will allow other blockchains to "lease" the security of the Cosmos Hub, making it as difficult to perform an economic attack on a consumer chain as it would be to perform the same attack on the Hub itself. We can think of this as the Hub granting its "economic security" to the consumer chain. This can be thought of as a form of hard power. 

In politics, hard power is the use of economic or military means to influence behavior. In our particular cryptographic environment, we can easily extend the metaphor to the use of economic security as an incentive to attract developers. In the Interchain ecosystem, we will see a market place of consumer chains seeking this economic security as a service. 

However, this is a narrow view of the environment that consumer chains will be navigating. They will not only seek economic security, but are also likely to seek healthy governance precedent, adequate tooling, financial support, and access to human resources like talent, ideas, and users. 

It should be clear from the above paragraph that hard power is only one means of exerting influence. In order to further strengthen the Hub's position as a Hub in the interchain, soft-power is another key component. 

In politics soft power is defined as the use of economic or culutral influence to influence behavior. In our cryptographic environment it can be thought of as the intangible areas that consumer chains will need beyond economic security. 

It is worth noting that a complex interplay of relationships across chains in the Interchain is one of the central components of the Cosmos ethos, and the Cosmos Hub's primary value proposition is to provide a firm foundation for navigating these relationships. By serving as this foundation, the Cosmos Hub and its stakeholders will accrue token fees of the chains that use its services. Thus, the Cosmos Hub is incentivized to provide the highest quality experience (in terms of both hard and soft power) for all those that choose to form a relationship with or around it. By doing so, it will attract the highest-quality talent and cement its role as an irreplacable Hub.

### Funding Public Goods

With the view of soft power in mind, it is clear that funding the maintenance and stewardship of two key components of the Cosmos software stack is valuable to the Cosmos Hub. Developers highly value both CosmWasm and CosmosJS, and consumer chains of the Cosmos Hub are highly likely to utilize these libraries in the emergent value they create for the ecosystem. 

By funding Confio, the Cosmos Hub asserts its willingness and ability to support the highest quality tooling in the Cosmos network, and thus support the chains that wish to use these tools. Supporting the Confio team is a valuable step in providing the intangible human resources that developers will look for when they are seeking a home for their next great idea. 

# Execution Details

## Community Pool Spend

*Assumptions*

All of the following statements are made using the following assumptions: 
- The ATOM price used in calculations is $15.005, which is the 1 year moving average price of ATOM as of February 2nd. 
- Proposal 95 has passed, and those 588,000 ATOM have been dispensed  
- The calculations used to determine the community pool budget can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bb6RZbL4YWe6LdWD7o1-TSuMMCIpbD6X0S1I4vAux4I/edit?usp=sharing
- In the spreadsheet, the Hub funds Confio's entire yearly expense. A more optimal outcome would be interchain collaboration in which each chain funds a percentage of Confio's needs. 

*Pool Percentage*
- Funding Confio with the ATOM equivalent of $2.5M from the Cosmos Hub equates to less than 1% of the USD value of the community pool on a monthly basis.
- Each tranche of community pool spend will consume for ~4.8% of the total ATOM in the community pool.

## Payment Details
The process for the community pool spend will be as follows: 

**Signaling vs. Community Pool Spend**
- Contingent upon the passing of the signaling proposal, the first pool spend proposal will be raised in early march, the second will be raised in August.
- The first payment proposal will be raised only if this proposal passes with a super-majority (>66%) of yes votes.

**ATOM Amounts & Sale Terms**
- Fund Confio with the ATOM equivalent of $2.5M with two separate community pool spend proposals, each requesting the ATOM equivalent of $1.25M. 
- At the average price ($15.005) given above, this equates to 83,305 ATOM per spend. 
- The ATOM will be liquidated over a 7 day period, equating to 11,900 ATOM being sold per day. 

**Fund Release**
- In order to provide a legally registered counter-party to fund Confio, the xyz foundation will function as the standing recipient of the community pool spend
- The funds will be released to a multi-sig wallet owned by the xyz Foundation with the following 5 signers: 
    - a, b, x, y, z
- After the ATOM are liquidated into USD, they will be transferred from the xyz Foundation to Confio
- Confio will release a statement declaring receipt of the funds and the resumption of public goods work 

# Signaling Proposal
This proposal is explicitly written as a signaling proposal in order to gauge the sentiment of the community. It is a method of communicating across the shareholder base and allowing ATOM holders to express their opinions with the weight of their vote, optimally creating a non-contentious governance environment and opportunities for feedback. 

# Voting Outcomes
- If this proposal passes, a community pool spend proposal will be raised. NOTE: the current proposal does not trigger the release of any funds. If it passes, the community indicates that at the present moment, with the available information, they have a willingness to release funds and compensate Confio with the ATOM equivalent of $2.5M, though the release of those funds is contingent upon the passing of the community pool spend proposals.
- If this proposal is rejected, at the present moment, no further action will be taken in regards to compensating Confio via a community pool spend proposal. 

# Voting Choices
- If you vote yes you signal your desire to compensate Confio via the Cosmos Hub community pool. 
- If you vote no you signal your dissent against compensating Confio via the Cosmos Hub community pool. 
- If you veto this proposal you deem it harmful to the network and wish to burn the proposer's ATOM. 
- If you abstain you signal your desire to contribute to quorum without a preference toward whether the proposal passes or fails.

# Open Questions
- Should the Hub be the sole patron of the Confio team or should it be an ecosystem wide effort?  
- What is the best way to liquidate the ATOM?
- Do ATOM stakeholders believe that using a foundation to act as a funding intermediary is the best approach? 
- What other areas of the proposal do you have feedback on? 
- What services would you like to see Confio offer the Hub? 
- Does it fall under the ATOM Accelerator DAO's mandate to share the burden of funding Confio?
